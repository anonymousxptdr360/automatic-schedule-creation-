How to use the calculator?

For example, if you have an internship that requires 80 hours and you have breaks such as Christmas, here’s an example:

In the first part, we’ll assume that you’ll need to make up some hours; otherwise, in our example, we would normally do 2 sessions per week. But with the makeup hours, we’ll take 3 sessions and define a period.

So, in “1. Define the Slot Palette,” we’ll enter Monday from 6:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. and click on “Add slot,” then add the same for Thursday, and finally for Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.

Next, in “2. Organize the Periods,” which is not a mandatory section, we’ll set up a period where we need to catch up in order to reach 80 hours on time. Select all the weeks to include them in the calculation — this gives us our first period (“Period 1”). Then, choose either the number of weeks or an end date you want for this period. We’ll check at the end how many weeks are needed to reach the 80 hours.

Now, to continue the rest of the internship without counting the end of the first period we’ve already configured, click on “Add a period” and select all the weeks except the days we added at the beginning for makeup sessions. In our case, that’s Thursday and Saturday. And that’s it — no need to touch these settings anymore.

Next, for example, if you have a break during your internship — in our case, Christmas — simply click on the calendar icon to make it more visual, then select a start date (e.g. December 20, 2025) and an end date (e.g. January 5, 2026), and click on “Add this break.” A small tab will appear at the bottom and will be included in the calculation.

Finally, just provide the start and end dates of your internship. Don’t forget to click on “Add a global end date (optional)” to include an end date. I still need to fix this part someday, but everything else works fine.

Then, select (or not) the optional settings if you want to display the days of the week (Monday to Sunday) or display the year (2025). Otherwise, simply click “Generate schedule,” and it will display the total number of hours and the schedule text showing all sessions.

There are two options to display the result horizontally or vertically, depending on your preference. Then, use the “Copy” button to copy everything.

So, in our example where we wanted to calculate 80 hours, just go to “Period 1,” increase or decrease the number of weeks to adjust, and click “Generate schedule” again to update the information.
